## Description

I have built an employee management system using inquirer, mysql and console tables. This is running on a node server and once you have installed all the npm packages you can run through the inquirer prompts to update an employee database. Users will be able to view multiple joined tables, update records, delete and add new data as well.

## Installation

The application has been set up to on the node server. You will need to install the relevant npm and login to mysql to set up the database.

## Tests

Please install Jest to run the test files
